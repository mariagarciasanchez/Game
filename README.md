Scissors

In this file, you can check how I built code for a lab from my Cybersecurity master's:

- I learned some basic languages as a backend developer.

- I'm happy because I got one of the best marks in my class and this project was useful for me to start with some programming languages.

- Now that I've improved further, I consider myself critical to improving some things in the design.

I hope this will be useful for some of you who want to become a developer.
